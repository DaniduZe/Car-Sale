# Car-Sale
This repository contains a C# project for a car sales management system that uses a SQL database for data storage. The project allows car dealerships to manage their inventory, sales, and customer information in a user-friendly and efficient manner.

The system enables dealerships to add new cars to their inventory, update pricing and availability, and track the status of each vehicle. Sales transactions can also be managed, including invoicing and payment processing. Customer information is stored securely and can be accessed easily when needed.

The SQL database stores all the information needed for the system, including car details, customer information, and transaction data. The C# code provides a user interface for managing the data and performing various operations.

This project is suitable for developers who want to learn about C# and SQL database development or who want to build a car sales management system from scratch. The project can be easily customized to meet specific business requirements.
